
Introduction of Statistics :

 Statistics is a branch of math focused on collecting, organizing, and understanding numerical data.
It involves analyzing and interpreting data to solve real-life problems, using various quantitative models.
Some view statistics as a separate scientific discipline rather than just a branch of math. 
It simplifies complex tasks and offers clear insights into regular activities.
Statistics finds applications in diverse fields like weather forecasting, stock market analysis, insurance, betting, and data science.

What are Statistics?

Statistics is a mathematical science including methods of collecting, organizing and analyzing data in such a
way that meaningful conclusions can be drawn from them. In general, its investigations and analyses fall
into two broad categories called descriptive and inferential statistics.

Descriptive statistics deals with the processing of data without attempting to draw any inferences from it.
The data are presented in the form of tables and graphs. The characteristics of the data are described in
simple terms. Events that are dealt with include everyday happenings such as accidents, prices of goods,
business, incomes, epidemics, sports data, population data.

Inferential statistics is a scientific discipline that uses mathematical tools to make forecasts and projections
by analyzing the given data. This is of use to people employed in such fields as engineering, economics,
biology, the social sciences, business, agriculture and communications.
